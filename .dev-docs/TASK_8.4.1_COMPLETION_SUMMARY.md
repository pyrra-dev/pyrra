# Task 8.4.1 Completion Summary

**Task:** Upstream comparison testing for regex label selectors  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Date:** 2025-10-14  
**Branch Tested:** `upstream-comparison`

---

## Summary

Comprehensive upstream comparison testing completed. **Key finding: The regex selector behavior is NOT a regression** - it is existing upstream Pyrra behavior.

### Issues Identified

1. **Grouping Creates Multiple SLOs** (Upstream Behavior)
   - When using `grouping` field, Pyrra creates multiple SLO instances from one YAML
   - Happens with both regex and simple selectors
   - Recording rules are created per-group correctly
   - Detail pages work correctly
   - **Status:** Documented as known limitation, not a bug

2. **NaN in Burn Rate Columns** (Upstream Bug)
   - Alert table shows NaN when there are no errors
   - Affects ALL SLOs (regex or not, grouping or not)
   - Root cause: Prometheus returns empty (not 0) for non-existent metrics
   - Availability/budget tiles work correctly
   - **Status:** Cosmetic issue, likely fixed in feature branch

### Issues NOT Present

- ❌ "No data" in availability/budget tiles (was a misunderstanding)
- ❌ Regex selectors breaking recording rules (they work correctly)
- ❌ Data inconsistency between pages (both show correct data)
- ❌ Regression from feature branch (behavior matches upstream)

---

## Test Results

### Test 1: Regex + Grouping (`test-regex-static`)

**Configuration:**
```yaml
grouping: [handler]
metric: prometheus_http_requests_total{handler=~"/api.*"}
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Multiple SLO instances created (one per handler)
- ✅ Recording rules created per-group with `sum by (handler)`
- ✅ Detail pages show correct data
- ❌ NaN in burn rate columns (no errors exist)

### Test 2: Regex WITHOUT Grouping (`test-regex-no-grouping`)

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# No grouping field
metric: prometheus_http_requests_total{handler=~"/api.*"}
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Single aggregated SLO created
- ✅ Recording rules aggregate across all handlers
- ✅ Detail page shows correct data
- ❌ NaN in burn rate columns (no errors exist)

### Test 3: Simple Selector Control (`test-simple-control`)

**Configuration:**
```yaml
# No regex, no grouping
metric: prometheus_http_requests_total{handler="/api/v1/query"}
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Single SLO created
- ✅ Recording rules work correctly
- ✅ Detail page shows correct data
- ❌ NaN in burn rate columns (no errors exist)

**Conclusion:** NaN issue is universal, not related to regex selectors.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Multiple SLOs with Grouping

**Cause:** Pyrra's design creates one SLO instance per unique grouping label value.

**Behavior:**
- Intentional or limitation? Unclear from upstream documentation
- Recording rules correctly scoped per-group
- Detail pages work as designed

**Recommendation:** Document as known behavior, provide guidance on when to use grouping.

### Issue 2: NaN in Burn Rate Columns

**Cause:** Prometheus returns empty results (not 0) when numerator is 0.

**Technical Details:**
```promql
# No errors exist
sum(rate(prometheus_http_requests_total{code=~"5.."}[3m])) → []

# Division with empty
[] / sum(rate(prometheus_http_requests_total[3m])) → []

# UI shows NaN
```

**Impact:**
- Cosmetic only - alerts work correctly
- Affects all SLOs when no errors
- Feature branch likely fixes this

---

## Deliverables

1. ✅ **Test SLO Configurations Created:**
   - `.dev/test-regex-static.yaml`
   - `.dev/test-regex-no-grouping.yaml`
   - `.dev/test-simple-control.yaml`

2. ✅ **Documentation Created:**
   - `.dev-docs/UPSTREAM_COMPARISON_REGEX_SELECTORS.md` - Complete test results and analysis
   - `.dev-docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` - Updated with findings

3. ✅ **Findings Documented:**
   - Multiple SLOs with grouping is upstream behavior
   - NaN issue is upstream bug affecting all SLOs
   - No regressions introduced by feature branch
   - Regex selectors work correctly

---

## Next Steps

### Task 8.4.2: Root Cause Analysis

**Status:** Can be completed based on testing findings

**Key Points to Document:**
- Grouping field creates multiple SLO instances (by design or limitation?)
- Recording rules correctly scoped per-group
- NaN issue is Prometheus empty result handling
- No architectural mismatch found

### Task 8.4.3: Solution Implementation

**Status:** Can be completed - Choose Option B (Document Limitation)

**Recommended Actions:**
1. ✅ Document grouping behavior in `.dev-docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` (DONE)
2. ✅ Document NaN issue in `.dev-docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` (DONE)
3. ⏭️ Verify feature branch fixes NaN issue
4. ⏭️ Add user guidance on when to use grouping vs aggregated SLOs
5. ⏭️ Update examples to show best practices

**No Code Changes Required:**
- Regex selectors work correctly
- Grouping behavior is upstream design
- NaN fix likely already in feature branch

## Recommendations for Upstream Contribution

### Include in PR

1. **NaN Fix** (if present in feature branch)
   - Show 0 instead of NaN when no errors
   - Improves user experience
   - Low risk change

2. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Clarify grouping field behavior
   - Provide guidance on regex selectors
   - Show best practices for aggregated vs per-endpoint SLOs

### Consider for Future

1. **Grouping Behavior Discussion**
   - Is multiple SLO instances intentional?
   - Should one YAML = one SLO?
   - Gather upstream maintainer feedback

2. **Recording Rule Optimization**
   - Already implemented in feature branch
   - Reduces Prometheus load
   - Good candidate for upstream contribution
