# Code Review Session - Dynamic Burn Rate Implementation

I need to conduct a thorough code review of the dynamic burn rate implementation for Pyrra SLO alerting. Please help me validate that all implementation is correct by deep diving into the code changes.

## Review Scope
Context: #file:FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

## What Was Implemented
- ✅ Dynamic burn rate support for Ratio and Latency indicators
- ✅ Performance optimization using recording rules instead of inline calculations
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintenance

## Key Files to Review

### 1. Core Implementation
- `slo/rules.go` - Main implementation file
  - Review `buildAlertExpr()` method - routing logic
  - Review `buildDynamicAlertExpr()` method - dynamic expression generation
  - Review helper methods `buildTotalSelector()` and `buildLatencyTotalSelector()`
  - Validate Ratio and Latency cases use recording rules efficiently
  - Check error handling and edge cases

### 2. Test Coverage
- `slo/rules_test.go` - Test implementation
  - Review `TestObjective_DynamicBurnRate()` - Ratio indicator tests
  - Review `TestObjective_DynamicBurnRate_Latency()` - Latency indicator tests
  - Review `TestObjective_buildAlertExpr()` - Expression building tests
  - Validate test assertions match actual behavior

### 3. Additional Files for Review
- `main.go` - Main application entry point
  - **⚠️ COMPILATION ERROR**: "main redeclared in this block" at line 100
  - Review for duplicate function declarations or merge conflicts
  - Check API server initialization and configuration
  - Validate Prometheus client setup and routing

- `main_test.go` - Main application tests
  - Review `TestMatrixToValues()` - Data transformation tests
  - Review `TestAlertsMatchingObjectives()` - Alert matching logic
  - Review benchmark tests for performance validation
  - Check test coverage for main application components

## Specific Review Points

### Mathematical Correctness
1. **Dynamic Formula Implementation**: Verify `(N_SLO / N_alert) × E_budget_percent_threshold × (1-SLO_target)`
2. **Error Budget Thresholds**: Confirm constants (1/48, 1/16, 1/14, 1/7) are correctly applied
3. **Window Period Mapping**: Check that alert windows map to correct thresholds

### Performance Optimization
1. **Recording Rule Usage**: Validate alert expressions use `burnrate:recordingRule{...}` not inline calculations
2. **PromQL Efficiency**: Check that only dynamic threshold is calculated inline
3. **Selector Building**: Review label matcher handling for performance

### Correctness & Edge Cases
1. **Backward Compatibility**: Verify static mode still works as before
2. **Default Behavior**: Confirm "static" is default when BurnRateType not specified  
3. **Error Handling**: Check graceful fallbacks when dynamic calculation fails
4. **Label Handling**: Validate proper metric selector construction
5. **⚠️ Compilation Issues**: Address "main redeclared" error in main.go
6. **Integration Points**: Verify main.go correctly integrates with SLO dynamic burn rate features

### Code Quality
1. **Code Structure**: Review method organization and separation of concerns
2. **Documentation**: Check code comments explain complex logic
3. **Test Quality**: Validate tests cover both happy path and edge cases

## Review Questions to Address
1. Are the generated PromQL expressions mathematically correct?
2. Do the recording rules provide the expected performance benefits?
3. Is the fallback to static mode seamless and correct?
4. Are all indicator type differences handled properly?
5. Do the tests adequately cover the implementation?
6. **⚠️ Critical**: What is causing the "main redeclared" compilation error in main.go?
7. Are there any integration issues between main.go and the dynamic burn rate features?
8. Do main_test.go tests properly validate the application's behavior with new features?

## Testing Commands for Validation
```bash
# Run dynamic burn rate specific tests
go test ./slo -v -run "TestObjective_DynamicBurnRate"
go test ./slo -v -run "TestObjective_buildAlertExpr"

# Run all SLO tests to check for regressions
go test ./slo

# Check for any compilation issues
go build ./slo

# ⚠️ PRIORITY: Fix compilation error first
go build . # This will show the "main redeclared" error

# Run main application tests after fixing compilation
go test . -v -run "TestMatrixToValues|TestAlertsMatchingObjectives"

# Full application build validation
go build .
```

## Repository Context
- Branch: add-dynamic-burn-rate  
- Owner: yairst/pyrra
- All changes committed and ready for review

Let's methodically go through each component to ensure the implementation is production-ready and mathematically sound.
