# Task 8.5: Production Documentation Updates

## Overview

This document summarizes the production documentation updates for the dynamic burn rate feature, following the principle of keeping updates "concise and proportional" - dynamic burn rate is ONE feature among many in Pyrra.

## Documentation Philosophy

**Key Principle**: Extensive documentation already exists in `.dev-docs/` for development purposes. Production documentation should extract ONLY essential user-facing content.

**Goal**: Users should understand:
1. The feature exists
2. How to enable it
3. Where to find examples
4. Basic use cases

Users do NOT need to become documentation experts or understand implementation details.

## Files Updated

### 1. README.md (Main Project Documentation)

**Changes Made**:
- Added "Dynamic Burn Rates" bullet under Features section
- Added new "Dynamic Burn Rate Alerting" section after "How It Works"

**Content Added**:
- Brief description (2 paragraphs)
- When to use (2 bullet points)
- Configuration example (4 lines)
- How it works (1 sentence with formula)
- Learn more link to Dev.to article (Error Budget is All You Need Part 2)
- Reference to examples

**Rationale**: Main README gets minimal addition - just enough to make users aware the feature exists and point them to examples.

### 2. examples/README.md (Examples Documentation)

**Changes Made**:
- Enhanced existing "Dynamic Burn Rate Examples" section
- Added "How it works" subsection
- Added "Migration from static to dynamic" note
- Enhanced configuration example with full context

**Content Added**:
- Expanded "When to use" from 2 to 3 bullet points
- Added "How it works" explanation (3 bullet points + formula)
- Added complete configuration example with comments
- Added migration guidance (1 sentence)

**Rationale**: Examples README is where users go to understand how to use features, so slightly more detail is appropriate here.

### 3. Dynamic Burn Rate Example Files

**Files Enhanced**:
- `examples/dynamic-burn-rate-ratio.yaml`
- `examples/dynamic-burn-rate-latency.yaml`
- `examples/dynamic-burn-rate-latency-native.yaml`
- `examples/dynamic-burn-rate-bool-gauge.yaml`

**Changes Made**:
- Added header comments explaining the example
- Added inline comments for key configuration fields
- Added use case descriptions
- Added indicator-specific notes (e.g., "Requires Prometheus 2.40+" for native histograms)

**Rationale**: Example files are self-documenting - users copy/paste these, so inline comments are valuable.

## What Was NOT Added

Following the "concise and proportional" principle, we deliberately did NOT add:

1. **Separate docs/DYNAMIC_BURN_RATE.md file**: Would overshadow existing content and create maintenance burden
2. **Mathematical deep-dives**: Formula is mentioned but not explained in detail
3. **Implementation details**: How recording rules work, query optimization, etc.
4. **Extensive troubleshooting**: Basic usage is straightforward
5. **Architecture diagrams**: Not needed for user-facing docs
6. **Performance benchmarks**: Users can test in their environment
7. **Comparison tables**: Static vs dynamic behavior is self-evident from description

## Documentation Structure

```
Production Documentation (User-Facing):
├── README.md
│   └── Brief feature mention + pointer to examples
├── examples/README.md
│   └── Expanded usage guide with configuration examples
└── examples/dynamic-burn-rate-*.yaml
    └── Self-documenting examples with inline comments

Development Documentation (Internal):
├── .dev-docs/CORE_CONCEPTS_AND_TERMINOLOGY.md
├── .dev-docs/FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
├── .dev-docs/TASK_*.md
└── .kiro/specs/dynamic-burn-rate-completion/
    ├── requirements.md
    ├── design.md
    └── tasks.md
```

## Migration Guidance

**Added to examples/README.md**:
> Migration from static to dynamic: Simply add `burnRateType: dynamic` to the `alerting` section. Error budget calculations remain identical - only alert thresholds adapt to traffic.

**Rationale**: One sentence is sufficient - the migration is trivial and users can test it themselves.

## Validation

All documentation files validated:
- ✅ No syntax errors
- ✅ YAML examples are valid
- ✅ Markdown formatting correct
- ✅ Links and references accurate
- ✅ Tone consistent with existing Pyrra documentation

## Success Criteria Met

- ✅ **Minimal and proportional**: Dynamic burn rate doesn't overshadow existing content
- ✅ **Clear usage examples**: Users can copy/paste and adapt
- ✅ **Migration guidance**: One-sentence migration note provided
- ✅ **Maintains structure**: No new doc files, existing structure preserved
- ✅ **Maintains tone**: Consistent with Pyrra's friendly, practical style

## User Journey

1. **Discovery**: User reads README.md → sees "Dynamic Burn Rates" in features
2. **Learning**: User clicks through to examples/README.md → understands when/how to use
3. **Implementation**: User copies example YAML → modifies for their service
4. **Testing**: User deploys and validates in their environment
5. **Migration**: User adds `burnRateType: dynamic` to existing SLOs if desired

## Conclusion

Documentation updates follow the "concise and proportional" principle:
- **Concise**: Only essential information in production docs
- **Proportional**: Dynamic burn rate is ONE feature, not the main focus
- **Practical**: Users can implement without becoming experts
- **Complete**: All necessary information provided, nothing more

The extensive `.dev-docs/` documentation remains available for contributors and maintainers who need implementation details.
