## Known Issues

### Issue #1: Tooltip Positioning at Top Edge of Screen
- **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox (all browsers affected)
- **Test Scenario**: Interactive Tooltips (Test 2)
- **Description**: When hovering over burn rate badges near the top edge of the browser window, tooltips extend beyond the visible area
- **Expected Behavior**: Tooltips should auto-adjust position to remain within viewport (Bootstrap tooltip default behavior)
- **Actual Behavior**: Tooltips extend above the visible area at the top of the screen
- **Workaround**: Scroll down slightly before hovering, or resize browser window
- **Severity**: Low (cosmetic issue, doesn't affect functionality)
- **Status**: Open
- **Affects**: Both Static and Dynamic badge tooltips

### Issue #2: Name Column Sorting Appears Random
- **Browser**: Chrome (likely affects all browsers)
- **Test Scenario**: Column Sorting (Test 3)
- **Description**: When sorting by the "Name" column, SLO names do not appear in alphabetical order
- **Expected Behavior**: Names should sort alphabetically (A-Z or Z-A)
- **Actual Behavior**: Names appear in seemingly random order
- **Workaround**: None needed - Burn Rate column sorting works correctly
- **Severity**: Low (pre-existing issue, not related to Burn Rate feature)
- **Status**: Open (pre-existing)
- **Note**: This issue existed before the dynamic burn rate feature was implemented

### Issue #3: White Page Crash for Dynamic SLOs with Missing Metrics
- **Browser**: Chrome, Firefox (all browsers affected)
- **Test Scenario**: Performance and Memory (Test 7) - discovered during navigation
- **Description**: Clicking on any burn rate graph button for dynamic SLOs with missing/broken metrics causes complete page crash (white screen)
- **Expected Behavior**: Graph should show error message or "No data available" gracefully
- **Actual Behavior**: JavaScript error crashes entire page: `TypeError: undefined is not iterable (cannot read property Symbol(Symbol.iterator))` at `BurnrateGraph.tsx:284` in `Array.from()` call
- **Root Cause**: `BurnrateGraph.tsx:284` calls `Array.from()` on undefined data when dynamic SLO has no metric data
- **Workaround**: Only use dynamic burn rates with SLOs that have valid, existing metrics
- **Severity**: HIGH (causes complete page crash, blocks user from viewing any content)
- **Status**: Open - **BLOCKER** for production use with missing metrics
- **Affects**: Only dynamic SLOs with missing/broken metrics (static SLOs handle this gracefully)
- **Related Errors**: 
  - `[BurnRateThresholdDisplay] No data returned for boolGauge indicator traffic query`
  - `POST http://localhost:9099/objectives.v1alpha1.ObjectiveService/GraphDuration 404 (Not Found)` (for latency SLOs)
- **Recommendation**: Fix required before production deployment if dynamic SLOs may have missing metrics

## Graceful Degradation Testing

### Network Throttling

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Test Environment**: Chrome with Slow 3G throttling

**Results**:
- Page loads successfully under slow network conditions
- Total load time: 17-18 seconds (acceptable for Slow 3G)
- Progressive loading observed: white page → table headers → content → formatting
- UI remains fully functional after loading (sorting, tooltips, column toggle all work)
- No crashes or errors
- **Minor Issue**: No loading spinner/indicator during initial white page phase (cosmetic UX issue)

**Conclusion**: Acceptable graceful degradation for slow networks

### API Failure Simulation

**Status**: ✅ PASS (tested as part of Error Handling in Chrome Test 8)

**Results**:
- When Pyrra API stopped: Browser shows standard "ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED" error
- When Pyrra API restarted: Clean recovery, all functionality restored
- No data corruption or lingering errors

**Conclusion**: Standard browser error handling, clean recovery

### Prometheus Unavailability

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Test Environment**: Stopped Prometheus StatefulSet (prometheus-k8s)

**Results**:
- Page loads successfully (no crash)
- Availability and Error Budget tiles show "Error" in red (clear visual feedback)
- Graphs display empty (no data)
- Alerts table shows header only (no body)
- Console shows meaningful errors:
  - `POST http://localhost:9099/prometheus.v1.PrometheusService/Query 500 (Internal Server Error)`
  - `ConnectError: prometheus query: Post "http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query": dial tcp [::1]:9090: connectex: No connection could be made`
- After Prometheus restart: Clean recovery, all data restored

**Conclusion**: Excellent graceful degradation with clear error states and clean recovery

**Note**: Prometheus data was lost during restart due to lack of persistent storage (emptyDir configuration in development environment). This is a configuration issue, not a feature bug.

## Migration Testing

### Static to Dynamic Migration

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Test SLO**: `test-migration` (apiserver_request_total ratio indicator, 99% target, 30d window)

**Migration Steps Tested**:
1. **Created static SLO**: Applied with `spec.alerting.burnRateType: static`
2. **Verified static behavior**:
   - Gray "Static" badge displayed in list and detail pages
   - Static thresholds: 0.140, 0.070, 0.020, 0.010
   - "Factor" column shown in alerts table
3. **Migrated to dynamic**: `kubectl patch` command to change `burnRateType: dynamic`
4. **Verified dynamic behavior**:
   - Green "Dynamic" badge displayed
   - Dynamic thresholds: 2.069e-4, 6.207e-4, 7.047e-4, 0.001 (traffic-aware, much lower due to below-average traffic)
   - "Error Budget Consumption" column shown in alerts table (not "Factor")
5. **Rolled back to static**: `kubectl patch` command to revert
6. **Verified rollback**:
   - Gray "Static" badge restored
   - Static thresholds restored: 0.140, 0.070, 0.020, 0.010
   - "Factor" column restored

**Results**:
- ✅ Migration seamless (no errors, ~30 second processing time)
- ✅ UI updates correctly after migration
- ✅ Thresholds recalculate correctly (traffic-aware adaptation working)
- ✅ Rollback works perfectly (complete restoration of static behavior)
- ✅ No data loss or corruption

**Conclusion**: Migration and rollback procedures work flawlessly

### Backward Compatibility

**Status**: ✅ PASS

**Test Approach**: Verified existing static SLOs unaffected by dynamic feature

**Results**:
- Static SLOs continue to display gray "Static" badges
- Static thresholds unchanged (0.140, 0.070, 0.020, 0.010 for 99% SLO)
- Static SLOs show "Factor" column (not "Error Budget Consumption")
- No errors or behavioral changes in static SLOs
- Static and dynamic SLOs coexist without conflicts

**Conclusion**: Perfect backward compatibility - static SLOs completely unaffected by dynamic feature

## Recommendations

### Recommended Browsers

**Fully Supported**:
- Chrome (Latest) - Reference browser, all features work correctly
- Firefox (Latest) - Identical behavior to Chrome, fully compatible

**Likely Compatible** (not tested):
- Edge (Latest) - Chromium-based, should match Chrome behavior
- Safari (Latest) - May have minor tooltip positioning differences

**Minimum Requirements**:
- Modern browser with ES6+ JavaScript support
- Bootstrap 4+ CSS compatibility
- Fetch API support

### Minimum Browser Versions

Based on feature requirements:
- **Chrome**: 90+ (ES6, Fetch API, modern CSS)
- **Firefox**: 88+ (ES6, Fetch API, modern CSS)
- **Edge**: 90+ (Chromium-based)
- **Safari**: 14+ (ES6, Fetch API)

### Known Limitations

1. **Tooltip Positioning**: Tooltips may extend beyond viewport at top edge of screen (cosmetic issue, all browsers)
2. **Missing Metrics Crash**: Dynamic SLOs with missing/broken metrics cause white page crash when clicking graph buttons (**HIGH severity blocker** - requires fix before production)
3. **No Loading Indicator**: Slow network conditions show white page without loading spinner during initial load (minor UX issue)
4. **Name Column Sorting**: Pre-existing issue unrelated to dynamic burn rate feature
