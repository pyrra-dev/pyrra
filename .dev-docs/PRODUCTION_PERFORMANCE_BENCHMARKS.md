## Scaling Characteristics

### API Response Time
- **Scaling Pattern**: Sub-linear scaling
- **Analysis**: 
  - 16 → 66 SLOs (+312%): API time increased 57% (46ms → 72ms)
  - 66 → 116 SLOs (+76%): API time remained stable (72ms → 72ms)
  - **Conclusion**: API response time scales sub-linearly with SLO count. After initial increase, performance stabilizes even with significant SLO additions.

### Memory Usage
- **Scaling Pattern**: Near-constant (excellent)
- **Analysis**:
  - 16 → 66 SLOs (+312%): Memory increased only 6% (1.6MB → 1.7MB)
  - 66 → 116 SLOs (+76%): Memory increased only 6% (1.7MB → 1.8MB)
  - **Conclusion**: Memory usage is extremely efficient and scales nearly constant with SLO count. Memory growth is minimal and predictable.

### Prometheus Query Performance
- **Scaling Pattern**: Stable/improving
- **Analysis**:
  - Baseline: 35ms average
  - Medium scale: 30ms average (-14%)
  - Large scale: 32ms average (-9% vs baseline)
  - **Conclusion**: Prometheus query performance remains stable and even improves slightly at scale, likely due to query caching and optimization.

### Overall System Stability
- **Max API Response Time**: Increased from 95ms → 212ms at large scale
- **Variability**: Response time variance increased at large scale (16ms-212ms range)
- **Goroutines**: Stable at 3 goroutines across all scales
- **Conclusion**: System remains stable but shows increased response time variability at large scale (100+ SLOs)

## Performance Comparison: Dynamic vs Static SLOs

### Test Configuration
- **Medium Scale**: 37 dynamic, 29 static (56% dynamic)
- **Large Scale**: 62 dynamic, 54 static (53% dynamic)

### Observations
- No significant performance difference observed between dynamic and static SLOs
- Both indicator types (ratio and latency) perform similarly
- Dynamic burn rate calculations do not add measurable overhead to API response times

## Indicator Type Distribution

### Generated Test SLOs
- **Ratio indicators**: 50% of generated SLOs
- **Latency indicators**: 50% of generated SLOs
- **Window variation**: 7d, 28d, 30d (rotating)
- **Target variation**: 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, 95% (rotating)

### Performance Impact
- No measurable performance difference between ratio and latency indicators
- Both indicator types scale equally well

## Recommendations

### Production Deployment

1. **SLO Count**: System can comfortably handle 100+ SLOs with acceptable performance
   - API response times remain under 100ms average
   - Memory usage is minimal and predictable
   - Prometheus query performance is stable

2. **Scaling Limits**: Based on testing:
   - **Recommended**: Up to 200 SLOs per Pyrra instance
   - **Maximum**: Likely 500+ SLOs before performance degradation
   - **Note**: Actual limits depend on hardware and Prometheus capacity

3. **Resource Allocation**:
   - **Memory**: 50MB minimum, 100MB recommended for 100+ SLOs
   - **CPU**: Minimal CPU usage observed, standard allocation sufficient
   - **Prometheus**: Ensure adequate Prometheus resources for recording rules

### Performance Optimization

1. **API Response Time**:
   - Average response times are acceptable (< 100ms)
   - Max response times can spike to 200ms+ at large scale
   - Consider implementing response caching for frequently accessed SLOs

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Memory usage is excellent and requires no optimization
   - Memory growth is minimal and predictable

3. **Prometheus Query Load**:
   - Query performance is stable and efficient
   - Recording rules optimization (Task 7.10) provides additional performance benefits
   - No additional Prometheus tuning required for tested scales

### Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Key Metrics to Monitor**:
   - API response time (p50, p95, p99)
   - Memory usage and growth rate
   - Prometheus query latency
   - SLO processing time in backend

2. **Alert Thresholds**:
   - API response time p95 > 500ms (warning)
   - API response time p95 > 1000ms (critical)
   - Memory usage > 200MB (warning)
   - Prometheus query failures > 1% (critical)
