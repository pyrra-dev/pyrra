# AI Development Quality Standards - MANDATORY REFERENCE

## üö® **CRITICAL RULES - CHECK EVERY TIME**

### **Rule 1: SYSTEMATIC COMPARISON ALWAYS**
- **Never analyze in isolation** - always compare with working examples
- **Create comparison tables** for any structural analysis
- **Question every difference** - why does X differ from Y?
- **Validate consistency** across similar components

### **Rule 2: COMPREHENSIVE STRUCTURE VALIDATION**
Before declaring anything "working":
- ‚úÖ **Naming conflicts** - check for duplicates/overwrites
- ‚úÖ **Complete coverage** - verify all expected components present
- ‚úÖ **Syntax validation** - test every query/expression
- ‚úÖ **Label consistency** - no duplicate or conflicting labels
- ‚úÖ **Error handling** - absent alerts, fallbacks where expected

### **Rule 3: QUESTION EVERYTHING APPROACH**
Instead of accepting generated output:
- **Why does this exist?** - understand purpose of every component
- **Why is this different?** - explain every deviation from patterns
- **What's missing?** - identify gaps in expected functionality
- **Does this actually work?** - test functionality, don't assume

### **Rule 4: TEST BEFORE DECLARE SUCCESS**
- **Syntax validation** - every query must parse correctly
- **Functional testing** - verify actual behavior matches expected
- **Edge case testing** - missing data, error conditions
- **Performance impact** - resource usage, query execution time

### **Rule 5: DOCUMENT ALL ISSUES IMMEDIATELY**
- **Don't skip problems** - document every discovered issue
- **Categorize severity** - critical bugs vs enhancement opportunities
- **Provide context** - explain why each issue matters
- **Suggest fixes** - concrete steps to resolve problems

## üìã **SESSION STARTUP CHECKLIST**

At the beginning of EVERY session:
1. **Read this file completely** - refresh memory of quality standards
2. **Review previous session results** - understand current state
3. **Identify comparison points** - what working examples exist?
4. **Set validation criteria** - define success/failure conditions
5. **Plan systematic approach** - don't rush into implementation

## üîß **ONGOING SESSION REMINDERS**

During any development work:
- **Pause frequently** - ask "what am I missing?"
- **Compare constantly** - reference working examples
- **Test incrementally** - validate each step before proceeding
- **Document thoroughly** - capture all findings and issues

## üéØ **QUALITY GATES - NO EXCEPTIONS**

Never proceed to next phase without:
- ‚úÖ **Complete structural analysis** - all components validated
- ‚úÖ **Syntax verification** - all queries tested and working
- ‚úÖ **Comparison validation** - differences explained and justified
- ‚úÖ **Issue documentation** - all problems catalogued with severity

## üìù **ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES**

If issues are missed:
1. **Stop immediately** - don't continue with flawed analysis
2. **Systematic review** - go back and apply all checklist items
3. **Update documentation** - add discovered issues to permanent record
4. **Improve process** - identify why checklist failed and enhance it

**REMEMBER**: Quality and thoroughness are more important than speed. 
Better to find all issues early than to build on a flawed foundation.
