# Dynamic Burn Rate Feature - Complete Implementation Summary

## Overview

The dynamic burn rate feature introduces adaptive alerting to Pyrra that adjusts alert thresholds based on actual traffic patterns rather than using fixed static multipliers. This implementation is based on the method described in the "Error Budget is All You Need" blog series.

## ✅ **COMPLETED: Priority 1 - Core Alert Logic Integration**

### Recent Changes (Latest Commit: d2e4959 + Recent Fixes + Code Review Complete)

## Core Concept & Formula

> **📚 For detailed explanations of terminology and mathematical concepts, see [CORE_CONCEPTS_AND_TERMINOLOGY.md](CORE_CONCEPTS_AND_TERMINOLOGY.md)**

### Quick Reference Formula
```
dynamic_threshold = (N_SLO / N_long) × E_budget_percent_threshold × (1 - SLO_target)
```

**Key Innovation**: The burn rate threshold itself is dynamic and adapts to traffic patterns. Both short and long windows use **N_long** for consistent traffic scaling, preventing false positives during low traffic and false negatives during high traffic.

### Error Budget Percent Thresholds (Constants)
| Window Period | E_budget_percent_threshold | 
|---------------|---------------------------|
| 1 hour        | 1/48 (≈0.020833)        | 
| 6 hours       | 1/16 (≈0.0625)          | 
| 1 day         | 1/14 (≈0.071429)        | 
| 4 days        | 1/7 (≈0.142857)         |

## Important Clarifications

### Recent Architectural Corrections (Session 2025-08-26)

**🔧 Multi-Window Logic Fix**: Corrected implementation to use **N_long** (long window period) for both short and long window traffic scaling calculations. This ensures consistent burn rate measurement across different time scales, matching the behavior of static burn rates.

**🔧 Window Period Scaling Integration**: Fixed `DynamicWindows()` to properly utilize the `Windows(sloWindow)` function for automatic period scaling. E_budget_percent_thresholds are now mapped based on static factor hierarchy rather than hardcoded time periods.

**🔧 Removed Code Duplication**: Eliminated unused `dynamicBurnRateExpr()` function that duplicated E_budget_percent logic.

**🔧 Window.Factor Semantic Clarity**: Clarified that `Window.Factor` serves dual purposes - static burn rate in static mode, E_budget_percent_threshold in dynamic mode.

### Formula Correction Notes

**E_budget_percent_threshold Clarification**: These are **constant values**, not calculated values. They represent the percentage of error budget consumption we want to alert on, regardless of SLO period choices. The values (1/48, 1/16, etc.) should remain consistent across different SLO configurations.

**Formula Direction**: The correct formula is `(N_SLO / N_long)` where:
- N_SLO = Events in SLO window (7d, 28d, etc.)
- **N_long = Events in LONG alert window** (used for both short and long window calculations)

This ensures consistent traffic scaling: both windows measure against the same traffic baseline.

### Indicator Type Support Strategy

**Current Priority**: Ratio indicators were implemented first because they:
1. Are the most common SLI type in production
2. Have the simplest metric structure (separate error and total metrics)
3. Allow the dynamic formula to be applied most straightforwardly

**Extension Strategy**: Other indicator types (Latency, LatencyNative, BoolGauge) fall back to static behavior temporarily while we validate the core dynamic implementation with Ratio indicators.

### Key Methods Status
| Method | Status | Purpose |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `DynamicWindows()` | ✅ Complete | Assigns E_budget_percent_threshold constants |
| `dynamicBurnRateExpr()` | ✅ Complete | Generates dynamic PromQL expressions |
| `Alerts()` | 🔧 Needs Integration | Alert rule generation (not using dynamic yet) |
| `QueryBurnrate()` | 🔧 Needs Update | PromQL generation (still static only) |

## Implementation Notes

### Formula Implementation Details - CORRECTED
```go
// In DynamicWindows() - E_budget_percent_thresholds mapped by static factor hierarchy
var errorBudgetBurnPercent float64
switch w.Factor { // w.Factor contains the static burn rate from Windows()
case 14: // First critical window - 50% per day
    errorBudgetBurnPercent = 1.0 / 48  // E_budget_percent_threshold
case 7: // Second critical window - 100% per 4 days  
    errorBudgetBurnPercent = 1.0 / 16  // E_budget_percent_threshold
case 2: // First warning window
    errorBudgetBurnPercent = 1.0 / 14  // E_budget_percent_threshold
case 1: // Second warning window
    errorBudgetBurnPercent = 1.0 / 7   // E_budget_percent_threshold
}
```

### PromQL Integration Pattern - CORRECTED
```promql
# Static: burn_rate > static_factor * (1 - slo_target)
# Dynamic: error_rate > ((N_slo / N_long) * E_budget_percent_threshold) * (1 - slo_target)
```

### Key Design Insights
1. **Window.Factor Dual Purpose**: Serves as static burn rate in static mode, E_budget_percent_threshold in dynamic mode
2. **Consistent Traffic Scaling**: Both windows use N_long denominator for uniform burn rate measurement
3. **Automatic Period Scaling**: Window periods scale with any SLO duration via `Windows(sloWindow)`
4. **Constant E_budget_percent**: E_budget_percent_thresholds remain fixed regardless of SLO period choice
