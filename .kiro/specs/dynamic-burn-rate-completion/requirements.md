# Dynamic Burn Rate Feature Completion - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification covers the completion of the dynamic burn rate feature for Pyrra, a Service Level Objective (SLO) management tool. The feature introduces traffic-aware **alert thresholds** that adapt based on actual traffic patterns, preventing false positives during low traffic and false negatives during high traffic periods.

**Critical Understanding**: Dynamic burn rates only affect **alert threshold calculations**. Error budget calculations remain identical between static and dynamic burn rates, using the standard formula: `((1-SLO_target)-(1-success/total))/(1-SLO_target)`.

The core implementation is complete (~30%), with backend logic, API integration, and basic UI functionality working for ratio indicators. This spec focuses on comprehensive validation across all indicator types, edge case handling, and production readiness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Indicator Type Validation

**User Story:** As an SRE managing diverse services, I want dynamic burn rate alerting to work correctly across all SLO indicator types, so that I can use traffic-aware alerting regardless of my service's metric patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a latency-based SLO uses dynamic burn rates THEN the UI SHALL display calculated threshold values instead of placeholder text
2. WHEN a latency_native SLO uses dynamic burn rates THEN histogram-based traffic calculations SHALL work correctly with `histogram_count(sum(increase(...)))` patterns
3. WHEN a bool_gauge SLO uses dynamic burn rates THEN boolean gauge traffic calculations SHALL use appropriate `count_over_time(...)` aggregations
4. WHEN any indicator type encounters missing metrics THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to appropriate fallback behavior
5. WHEN switching between static and dynamic SLOs of different indicator types THEN the UI SHALL maintain consistent user experience and performance

### Requirement 2: Enhanced User Experience with Traffic Context

**User Story:** As an SRE using the Pyrra UI, I want visual context about traffic patterns and their impact on dynamic burn rate calculations, so that I can understand why thresholds adapt and validate the system's traffic-aware behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing RequestsGraph for dynamic SLOs THEN the graph SHALL show average traffic baseline as visual reference
2. WHEN current traffic differs significantly from average THEN visual indicators SHALL highlight above/below average traffic patterns
3. WHEN hovering over traffic data THEN tooltips SHALL show traffic ratio context and impact on alert sensitivity
4. WHEN comparing static vs dynamic SLOs THEN the UI SHALL clearly show how traffic patterns affect threshold calculations
5. WHEN viewing burn rate type badges THEN tooltips SHALL include current traffic context and sensitivity impact

### Requirement 3: Resilience and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a platform engineer deploying Pyrra in production, I want the system to handle edge cases gracefully, so that missing metrics or insufficient data don't cause system failures or misleading alerts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN base metrics are missing or non-existent THEN both static and dynamic SLOs SHALL handle the situation without crashes
2. WHEN metric history is insufficient for long windows THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback calculations or clear error states
3. WHEN Prometheus queries timeout or fail THEN the UI SHALL display meaningful error messages and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN mathematical edge cases occur (division by zero, negative values) THEN conservative fallback thresholds SHALL be applied
5. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN query performance SHALL remain acceptable with appropriate caching and optimization

### Requirement 4: Alert Firing Validation

**User Story:** As an SRE relying on SLO alerts for incident response, I want proof that dynamic burn rate alerts fire correctly when thresholds are exceeded and do not fire when they shouldn't, so that I can trust the system for production monitoring with both high precision and recall.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN error rates exceed dynamically calculated thresholds THEN alerts SHALL fire in AlertManager within expected time windows (recall validation)
2. WHEN error rates remain below dynamically calculated thresholds THEN alerts SHALL NOT fire inappropriately (precision validation)
3. WHEN comparing identical error conditions THEN dynamic alerts SHALL demonstrate improved sensitivity AND specificity compared to static alerts
4. WHEN traffic patterns vary significantly THEN dynamic thresholds SHALL adapt appropriately and maintain consistent alert behavior
5. WHEN synthetic error conditions are created THEN the end-to-end alert pipeline SHALL function correctly from Prometheus rules to AlertManager
6. WHEN alert conditions resolve THEN alerts SHALL clear appropriately without persistent false alerting

### Requirement 5: Production Readiness and Performance

**User Story:** As a platform team deploying Pyrra at scale, I want the dynamic burn rate feature to perform well in production environments, so that it can handle real-world workloads without degrading system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing multiple dynamic SLOs simultaneously THEN UI performance SHALL remain responsive with acceptable query load
2. WHEN deployed in production environments THEN the feature SHALL integrate seamlessly with existing Pyrra installations
3. WHEN processing large numbers of SLOs THEN memory usage and query performance SHALL scale appropriately
4. WHEN network conditions are poor THEN the UI SHALL handle API failures gracefully with appropriate retry logic
5. WHEN upgrading from static to dynamic burn rates THEN migration SHALL be seamless without service disruption

### Requirement 6: Documentation and Deployment Validation

**User Story:** As a new user of Pyrra's dynamic burn rate feature, I want comprehensive documentation and validated deployment procedures, so that I can successfully implement and troubleshoot the feature in my environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN following installation guides THEN complete deployment instructions SHALL result in working dynamic burn rate functionality
2. WHEN encountering common issues THEN troubleshooting documentation SHALL provide clear resolution steps
3. WHEN migrating from static SLOs THEN migration guides SHALL explain the process and expected behavior changes
4. WHEN optimizing performance THEN tuning guidelines SHALL help achieve optimal query performance and resource usage
5. WHEN contributing to the project THEN development workflow documentation SHALL enable successful local development setup
