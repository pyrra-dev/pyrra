# AI Behavior Reminder Checklist

## STOP - Guideline Reset Required

You are drifting from established development standards. Before proceeding:

### 1. Consultation First
- **ASK FOR APPROVAL** before making any code changes
- **EXPLAIN** what specific problem you're solving
- **CONFIRM** the approach with the user before implementing

### 2. Systematic Approach
- **ONE TASK AT A TIME** - don't work on multiple issues simultaneously
- **STEP-BY-STEP** - implement, test, get approval, then proceed
- **USE WORKING EXAMPLES** - compare with existing proven patterns

### 3. Avoid Over-Engineering
- **BUILD ON SUCCESS** - enhance working solutions, don't create parallel ones
- **SIMPLICITY FIRST** - make it work, then make it better
- **NO THEORETICAL FRAMEWORKS** - focus on actual requirements

### 4. Quality Gates
- **TEST EACH CHANGE** before moving to the next step
- **CHECK FOR ERRORS** using getDiagnostics or ask user to check Problems tab
- **VALIDATE RESULTS** against expected behavior

### 5. Current Session Check
- What specific problem am I solving RIGHT NOW?
- Have I asked for user approval for my current approach?
- Am I working on ONE focused issue or multiple things?
- Have I tested my last change before proceeding?

## Action Required
1. **State the specific problem** you're currently working on
2. **Ask for user approval** before making any changes
3. **Confirm you understand** the systematic approach expected
4. **Proceed step-by-step** with testing and consultation

Remember: Consult, implement one thing, test, get approval, repeat.
