# Dynamic Burn Rate Validation Session Prompt

## Session Context
Previous sessions successfully completed **basic UI functionality testing** and resolved **critical production deployment issues** for the dynamic burn rate feature. Static threshold display now works correctly in embedded UI (production). However, **critical data validation and real-world functionality issues** remain that need comprehensive investigation and resolution.

## âœ… Previous Session Achievements
- **UI Components Working**: Green/gray badges, tooltips, sorting, navigation all functional
- **API Integration**: burnRateType field transmission confirmed
- **Mixed Environment**: 7 SLOs (2 dynamic + 5 static) environment established
- **Windows Compatibility**: API architecture documented, CRD generation workarounds identified
- **ðŸŽ‰ PRODUCTION ISSUE RESOLVED**: Static SLO threshold display fixed in embedded UI (port 9099)
- **Critical Documentation Added**: Complete UI build workflow documented for future developers

## âœ… Major Production Issue Resolved (September 4, 2025)
**Issue**: Static SLOs showed "14x, 7x, 2x, 1x" in embedded UI while development UI showed correct calculated thresholds
**Solution**: Implemented complete UI build workflow (`npm run build` â†’ `make build` â†’ restart)
**Result**: Embedded UI now displays correct calculated thresholds (e.g., "0.700, 0.350, 0.100, 0.050" for 95% SLO)
**Documentation**: Added workflow guidance to CONTRIBUTING.md, ui/README.md, and FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

## ðŸš¨ Critical Issues Identified Requiring Investigation

### **Issue 1: Missing Availability/Budget Data** 
**Problem**: All SLOs show "No data" in Availability and Budget columns despite API integration working
- **Root Cause**: Likely no actual metric data available for prometheus_http_requests_total in test environment
- **Impact**: Cannot validate real-world SLO calculations, error budget consumption, or threshold behavior
- **Investigation Needed**: 
  - Check if prometheus_http_requests_total has actual data in our cluster
  - Investigate why GetStatus API endpoint returns empty responses
  - Consider using metrics with real data (API server metrics, etc.)
  - Potentially create synthetic load to generate test data

### **Issue 2: Data Correctness Validation Missing**
**Problem**: No validation of actual burn rate calculations, thresholds, or dynamic vs static behavior
- **Root Cause**: Testing focused on UI display, not mathematical correctness of underlying calculations
- **Impact**: Cannot confirm dynamic thresholds are actually calculated correctly
- **Investigation Needed**:
  - Validate dynamic threshold calculations match expected formula
  - Compare static vs dynamic burn rate values in real scenarios  
  - Verify short/long window burn rates are calculated properly
  - Test threshold adaptation based on traffic volume changes

### **Issue 3: Real-Time Dynamic Threshold Display Enhancement**
**Problem**: Dynamic SLOs show generic "Traffic-Aware" text instead of real-time calculated threshold values
- **Root Cause**: Implementation uses placeholder text rather than actual calculated values
- **Impact**: Users cannot see actual threshold values, reducing observability and debugging capability
- **Enhancement Needed**:
  - Display actual calculated dynamic threshold: `(N_SLO/N_long) Ã— E_budget_percent Ã— (1-SLO_target)`
  - Show current burn rate vs threshold in tooltip: `current_burn_rate Ã— (1-slo_target)`
  - Provide real-time threshold updates based on traffic patterns

### **Issue 4: Prometheus Rules Generation Investigation**
**Problem**: Prometheus UI may not be showing generated rules correctly when both test and example SLOs are applied
- **Root Cause**: Potentially resolved in previous sessions but not documented in .dev-docs
- **Impact**: Cannot validate that dynamic burn rate expressions are actually being used by Prometheus
- **Investigation Needed**:
  - Verify Prometheus rules are generated with correct dynamic expressions
  - Check if rules are loading properly in Prometheus UI
  - Validate that dynamic threshold calculations are present in generated PromQL
  - Document the resolution if previously fixed

## ðŸŽ¯ Session Objectives

### **Phase 1: Data Infrastructure Validation**
1. **Metric Data Investigation**:
   - Check what metrics actually have data in our test environment
   - Investigate prometheus_http_requests_total data availability

   - Potentially generate synthetic load for testing

2. **API Data Flow Analysis**:
   - Debug why GetStatus endpoint returns empty responses
   - Investigate recording rules and metric availability
   - Validate that SLO calculations can access necessary data

### **Phase 2: Dynamic Threshold Calculation Validation**

   - Compare dynamic vs static rule generation

2. **Prometheus Integration Validation**:
   - Confirm rules load properly in Prometheus UI
   - Test rule evaluation and alerting behavior
   - Validate recording rules generate expected metrics

### **Phase 4: End-to-End Functional Testing**

   - Validate SLO calculations produce meaningful results
   - Compare static vs dynamic behavior under different conditions

2. **Load Testing for Dynamic Behavior**:
   - Generate traffic to test threshold adaptation
